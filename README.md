## 1. Introduction
The purpose of this test plan is to outline the testing approach for the https://teodent.ro/ website, with a specific focus on the "Contact" and "Programeaza-te" sections. The testing scope includes GUI and functional testing techniques to ensure a seamless experience for users scheduling appointments and contacting the clinic.

### 1.1 Test Objectives
* Apply knowledge and skills in a real-world testing scenario.
* Gain practical experience by implementing a real application and demonstrating theoretical knowledge.
* Verify the functionality and ease of use of the https://teodent.ro/ website, particularly the "Programeaza-te" and "Contact" sections.
* Ensure a seamless end-to-end flow for scheduling appointments and contacting the clinic.
* Identify and report any encountered issues or defects during testing.

### 1.2 Functionalities in Scope
* Successful appointment booking by completing the appointment form.
* Ability to contact the office using the contact form.

### 1.3 Functionalities Out of Scope
* Non-functional testing (performance, security, compatibility).
* Testing on specific hardware configurations or devices.
* Testing functionalities related to other product types.
* Automated testing.

* Requirements documentation is accessible.
* Testing tools and resources are prepared and available.

Exit Criteria:
* Completion of all scheduled test cases.
* Identification, documentation, and tracking of issues and defects for resolution.
* Creation and review of test reports and documentation.
* Achievement of test objectives set by stakeholders.
* Project deadline reached.

Risks:
* Project Risks: Resource constraints, scope limitations, communication issues, budget overruns.
* Product Risks: Incomplete or inaccurate content, compatibility issues, security vulnerabilities, performance issues, and functional deficiencies.

### 2.2. Test Analysis
* Assess business requirements and acceptance criteria for relevant functionality.
* Define the test method, categories, and techniques.
* Describe the conditions to be tested during the testing process.
* GUI testing techniques include positive testing, negative testing, boundary value analysis, and equivalent partitioning testing.

#### Test Conditions for "Programeaza-te" and "Contact" Categories:
1. Evaluation of Displaying the Correct Interface
2. Verification of Required Field Marking
3. Recording of Programming with Correct Information
4. Non-Recording of Programming with Incorrect Information
5. Functionality of the "Termeni si conditii" Link
6. Testing of the "Trimite" Button

### 2.3. Test Design
* Utilize the Zephyr Squad tool for test case creation.
* Test design techniques: positive testing, negative testing, and use case testing based on specification analysis.

### 2.4. Test Implementation
* Prepare the test environment: https://teodent.ro/
* Create a cycle summary.
* Include test cases in the cycle summary.

### 2.5. Test Execution
* Execute test cases according to the created test cycle summary.
* Identify errors based on performed tests.
* Generate a bug report for identified issues.

### 2.6. Test Closure
* Perform additional tests to ensure successful resolution of defects.
* Include test activities, results, and suggestions in the test closure report.

### 2.7. Test Monitoring and Control
Will be done by generating periodic test status reports that will reflect the testing progress and will signal any new project risks that will be identified in order to be mitigated.
